'''2.)Below we have results of a simple experiment to look at the visitation of various bee species to different plants.
The number of bees observed was as follows.
i)Buff Tail:10 1 37 5 12
ii)Garden bee:8 3 9 6 4
iii)Red Tail:18 9 12 4
iv)Carder bee: 8 27 6 32 23
v)Honey Bee: 12 13 16 9 10
Make five simple numeric vectors of these data. 
Next join the bee vectors together to make a data frame. 
Each row of the resulting frame relates to specific plant, the plant names are Thistle,Vipers,Golden Rain,Yellowalfala and blackberry. 
Use these names to create row labels for the data
